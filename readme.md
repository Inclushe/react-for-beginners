# React for Beginners with Parcel (unfinished)

I went through this with updated dependencies and gave up because React Router and Firebase changed so much that it wasn't worth continuing.

## Usage

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Inclushe/react-for-beginners.git
$ cd react-for-beginners
$ npm install

# To watch the build process
$ npm run watch

# To build the app
$ npm run build
```
